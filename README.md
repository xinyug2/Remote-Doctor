# Remote-Doctor
Development of a low cost, portable, medical monitoring system.  
We built a simple kernel and utilized a non-preemptive schedule to manage the selection and execution of the set of tasks comprising our system. We took the first steps towards implementing and incorporating the Peripheral Subsystem by replacing several of the modeled / simulated measurement capabilities with the initial design of the drivers to support the specified tasks and developed the initial support for the Intrasystem Communication Channel.
